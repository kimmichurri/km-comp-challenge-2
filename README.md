## About the site

This site is a job posting page complete with various menu items, a job description table and links to reach out via social media or email.

## Tech/Framework Used

CSS and HTML

## Features

This site is fully "responsive" to 320px for mobile complete with hover states and links.

## Challenges/Wins

I challenged myself to try using grid on this website. I struggled with how to use grid with media queries but through reading, trial and error was able to make a site that looks great at various page widths all the way down to 320px. I used a table for the first time and found this helpful in organizing information. In my next project I will attempt to make a table-like structure using grid for comparison. 

Another challenge I faced is that when I opened my site in Firefox the buttons were a different color. They did not look bad but in the future I would resolve this issue so that the spec holds up against all browsers.
